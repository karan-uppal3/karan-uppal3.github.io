I am an undergraduate student at the [Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/) where I'm pursuing an Integrated MSc. course in Mathematics and Computing. Most recently, I was part of the [Data Science for Social Good program](https://warwick.ac.uk/research/data-science/warwick-data/dssgx/) organised jointly by the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/) and [University of Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk/), wherein I worked on spatio-temporal forecasting using high-resolution geographic datasets, in collaboration with [UN-REDD](https://www.un-redd.org/). Previously, I worked with [Dr. Shashank Singh](https://sss1.github.io/) on modelling human attention using deep learning at the Empirical Inference Department under [Prof. Bernhard Sch√∂lkopf](https://is.mpg.de/~bs) at the [Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems](https://is.mpg.de/). My research interests are in the broad areas of deep learning and computer vision. I also am interested in using AI to aid and support social causes.

Formerly, I've worked with [Mr. Megh Makwana](https://www.linkedin.com/in/megh-makwana-4a378a147/) at [NVIDIA WWFO - Solution Architect and Engineering](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/) on some exciting problems, building several end-to-end deployable GPU accelerated applications. I was also a research associate at [Prof. Hanspeter Pfister's](https://vcg.seas.harvard.edu/people/hanspeter-pfister) [Visual Computing Group (VCG), Harvard University](https://vcg.seas.harvard.edu/) where I worked on semi-supervised segmentation for EM connectomics. More details about my previous experience can be found [here](https://karan-uppal3.github.io/experience).
